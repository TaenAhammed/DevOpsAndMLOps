Planning => Backlog => Sprint Start (Todo =)

Planning (Business Analyst, Product Owner, Scrum Master)
- Gather requirements
- Define user stories (Agile: Epic, Story, Task => Sub Tasks) 
- Put it in the backlog(TerraGrunt) [future xplorable] (bucket list). Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). 
    Already adopted at your organization. (EC2 Launch for the dev environment of the [genZfashionAPI]).
    Repeatation of Terraform modules across multiple projects.
    TerraGrunt (Terraform code reusability & Modularity is hudge).
    Quarter planning of the deliverables(already fixed):
    Q1, q2 (current), q3(c), q4 (bonus sprint, hachathon)
- Prioritize backlog (estimation).
  Each story/tasks/sub-tasks has some points (1(easy => can be done within a few hours), 2(day), 3(2-3 day), 5(week))
- Create sprint backlog. (choosed tickets)
Sprint Planning and Estimation (capacity valuation: 25-30)
